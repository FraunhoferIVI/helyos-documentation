
Overview
========
**helyOS is a framework for accelerating the development of yard automation projects.**

In the helyOS framework, developers create and tailor autonomous driving applications by adding and combining microservices via a graphic interface or programmatically via the helyOS database. helyOS provides a clean architecture guide where microservices are ascribed to specific domains. Microservices of each domain remain decoupled, which allows teams to change, remove or add code without affecting other parts of the application.

Why you should use helyOS
-------------------------

**Product Managers**

- The helyOS architecture is scalable and resilient. This means there are fewer problems to resolve in production.
- It reinforces domain driven design. This means: clear responsibility boundaries between teams.

**Software & Frontend Developers**

- helyOS is reusable, it provides a ready-to-use backend that is configurable via dashboard.
- The helyOS GraphQL API gives full control of the application data to the frontend developer. It is not necessary to change any line of code in the backend to access the data in the frontend. 

**Motion Algorithm Programmers**

- helyOS provides a ready-to-use environment to interact with robot vehicles. Programmers can focus on the development and evaluation of their motion algorithms.
- It is programming language independent, and you can host the algorithms in the computer or in the cloud, e.g., as a paid service.

**Automation Engineers**

- Complete flexibility for automated vehicles regarding assignment data formats.
- Flexibility regarding the degree of automation of agents. 
- Embedded security mechanisms.
